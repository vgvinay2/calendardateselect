There is some rough documentation here: [Documentation](Documentation.md)

The DEMO is the largest source for documentation.  See the [demo](InstallTheDemo.md)

This plugin is intended for rails users.  If you want to use the JavaScript for a different framework, view the source code for the demo.  There's plenty of example code there to help you learn how to use it.

Thanks!
